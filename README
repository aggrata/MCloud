MCloud is a managed unified interface to various cloud providers.  It
is heavily based on libcloud (http://www.libcloud.net) with only small
changes to make the API more .net friendly.

This project is obviously not very far along but checkout test.cs to
see what you can do.  To run this test you need to have a linode API
key.  Also you should note that running this test will create/delete a new
Linode on your account and that is going to cost you a days worth of
Linode service (Aprox $1).
